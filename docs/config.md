# Configuration API

This section describes the API for configuring the CryptoAuthentication device. The configuration zone is used to configure the device's behavior and properties.

---

### `(d *Device) ReadConfigZone()`

```go
ReadConfigZone() (data []byte, err error)
```

Reads the entire configuration zone.

*   **Returns**: The configuration data and an error if any.

---

### `(d *Device) WriteConfigZone(...)`

```go
WriteConfigZone(data []byte) (err error)
```

Writes to the configuration zone.

*   **data**: The configuration data to write.
*   **Returns**: An error if any.

---

### `(d *Device) WriteConfigCounter(...)`

```go
WriteConfigCounter(id uint16, value uint32) (err error)
```

Writes to one of the two monotonic counters in the configuration zone.

*   **id**: The counter ID (0 or 1).
*   **value**: The value to write to the counter.
*   **Returns**: An error if any.

## Configuration Structs

The configuration of the device is represented by a set of structs. The main struct is `ConfigZone`, which contains all the other configuration structs.

### `ConfigZone`

This is the top-level struct that represents the entire configuration zone of the device. It has a `Bytes()` method to serialize the configuration into a byte slice that can be written to the device.

### `SlotConfig`

This struct defines the configuration for each of the 16 slots.

### `SecureBootConfig`

This struct configures the secure boot feature.

### `ChipOptionsConfig`

This struct configures various chip options.

### `KeyConfig`

This struct defines the configuration for each of the 16 keys.

## Configuration Constants

There are many constants that are used to configure the device. These constants are defined in the `config/config.go` file. Please refer to the source code for a complete list of all available constants.
